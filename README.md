# Nuxt 3 + GSAP ScrollTrigger Technical Overview

This document summarizes the integration of GSAP ScrollTrigger into a Nuxt 3 application, covering architecture, core patterns, and best practices—without extensive code snippets.

---

## 1. Architecture & Dependencies

- **Nuxt 3** as the application framework for server-side rendering, routing, and module ecosystem.
- **GSAP** for performant, scroll-driven animations.
- **ScrollTrigger** plugin to synchronize animations with scroll progress.
- **ScrollToPlugin** for programmatic scrolling (optional).
- **TresJS / Three.js** for WebGL-driven scenes, if 3D content is required.
- **Tailwind CSS** (or other CSS frameworks) for utility-based styling.

Dependencies are managed via `npm`, and GSAP is transpiled through Nuxt’s build system to ensure compatibility with Vite.

## 2. Plugin Initialization

Create a single Nuxt plugin (e.g. `plugins/gsap.client.ts`) that:

- Imports the GSAP core and necessary plugins.
- Registers plugins with `gsap.registerPlugin(...)`.
- Exposes the configured GSAP instance via `useNuxtApp()` so components can access it as `$gsap`.

This central approach avoids duplication and keeps plugin registration isolated from page logic.

## 3. ScrollTrigger Integration Patterns

### Basic ScrollTrigger

- **Trigger configuration**: define `trigger` element, `start`/`end` offsets, and `scrub` behavior.
- **Markers**: enable during development to visualize trigger boundaries.
- **Callbacks**: use `onUpdate`, `onEnter`, and `onLeave` to execute custom logic or logging.

### Composable Abstraction

Encapsulate ScrollTrigger setup in a reusable composable (e.g. `useScrollTrigger`) that:

- Accepts an element reference and optional override settings.
- Registers the plugin and creates the trigger on mount.
- Simplifies component code to a single hook invocation.

This DRY pattern promotes consistency and ease of maintenance across multiple sections or components.

## 4. Advanced Timeline Techniques

When animating multiple properties or orchestrating sequential fades:

1. **Scrubbed Timeline**: build a GSAP timeline tied to a ScrollTrigger, allowing complex sequences to map 1:1 to scroll progress.
2. **Empty Segments**: insert no-op segments in the timeline to reserve scroll windows (e.g. a 10% window for fade‑in, 80% hold, 10% fade‑out).
3. **Staggering**: apply stagger delays to groups of elements for cascading effects.

These techniques give precise control over animation timing relative to the user’s scroll.

## 5. Three.js / TresJS Scroll-Driven Animations

To integrate 3D scenes:

- Initialize your WebGL scene and objects inside a Nuxt component’s `onMounted`.
- Remove or pause any manual render loops if your animation can be fully driven by scroll.
- Create a ScrollTrigger with `scrub: true`, and in its `onUpdate` callback, map `self.progress` to object properties (e.g. rotation, mixer time, camera position).

This approach turns scroll into a natural timeline for 3D interactions without additional RAF loops.

## 6. Layout & Scroll Context

Ensure a single scroll context for predictable behavior:

- **Body scroll**: let the browser’s main scrollbar handle page movement, or
- **Fixed container**: use a `h-screen overflow-y-auto` wrapper, and pass its element as `scroller` to ScrollTrigger.

Avoid nested scrollable regions to prevent multiple scrollbars and conflicting triggers.

---

## 7. Best Practices

- **SSR Safety**: run GSAP and ScrollTrigger setup in client-only hooks (`onMounted` or `.client.ts` plugins).
- **Development vs. Production**: enable visual markers only in development; disable them in production builds to reduce overhead.
- **Composable-First**: favor composables or directives to abstract repetitive animation logic.
- **Performance**: throttle heavy animations, batch updates, and consider `will-change` CSS hints.
- **Accessibility**: ensure scroll-driven content degrades gracefully for users without JavaScript.

By following this structured approach, you can create maintainable, performant, and user-friendly scroll-based animations in Nuxt 3, from simple 2D fades to rich 3D WebGL experiences.
